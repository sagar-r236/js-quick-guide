Map : Map function is used to transform an array.

Trnasformation means suppose you have transform each and every value in an array and get a new array out of it.

syntax:

let say you have an array

const arr = [5,2,3,4,5]

//map is a higher order function, so whatever the function which you pass inside the map will be applied to all 
//the elements of the array and returns an array

function double(x){
    return x**2;
}

const output = arr.map(double)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filter : filter is used to filter an array!, let say suppose you have to filter all the number greater than 5 you 
use filter. in callback function we have to use return type which is bollean if it true the element will be put in 
an return array from filter function or else no.

const output = arr.filter((x) => x>3)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reduce : Reduce is used to perform a operation on all the elements of the array and return a single value out of it

reduce function takes two arguments first is the callback function, and callback takes two arguments first is accumaltor and
second is current, the accumaltor collects the value and current is the current value the function is iterating through.
second argument for the reduce function is value of accumaltor.

eg:

Remember : the function will be called on each value of the array

const arr = [1,2,3,4]

arr.reduce(function (acc, cur) {
    acc = acc + cur;
    return acc;
}, 0)

//finding larges element

arr.reduce((acc,cur) => {
   
    if (cur > acc){
        acc = cur  ;
    };
    return max;
}, 0)
